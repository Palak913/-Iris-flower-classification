# -Iris-flower-classification
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

The Iris dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset to understand classification and clustering algorithms in machine learning. By using the features of the iris flowers, researchers and data scientists can classify each sample into one of the three species.

This dataset is particularly popular due to its simplicity and the clear separation of the different species based on the features provided. The four features are all measured in centimeters.

Sepal Length: The length of the iris flower's sepals (the green leaf-like structures that encase the flower bud).
Sepal Width: The width of the iris flower's sepals.
Petal Length: The length of the iris flower's petals (the colored structures of the flower).
Petal Width: The width of the iris flower's petals.
The target variable represents the species of the iris flower and has three classes: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

Iris setosa: Characterized by its relatively small size, with distinctive characteristics in sepal and petal dimensions.
Iris versicolor: Moderate in size, with features falling between those of Iris setosa and Iris virginica.
Iris virginica: Generally larger in size, with notable differences in sepal and petal dimensions compared to the other two species.
